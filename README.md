📍 Project Objective:
The Mini Instagram Database System is a simplified version of Instagram that enables users to create accounts, post images, like and comment on posts, and follow other users. This project helps students understand database design, relationships, and SQL queries for real-world applications.

📍 Key Features:
✔ User Management – Users can sign up, store profile details (username, email, bio), and update information.
✔ Post Management – Users can create posts, upload images, and add captions.
✔ Like System – Users can like posts, and likes are counted per post.
